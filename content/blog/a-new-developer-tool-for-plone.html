<p>A new developer tool was placed in the Collective. This Ajax tool offers a python prompt similar to running "zopect debug" or breaking into the zope through a pdb call. It is really cool and useful inÂ  debugging and exploring Plone. I'd rank this tool as extremely important to the regular Plone developer, along DocFinder or the pdb debugging module.</p><p>Current location is here:<a href="http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Clouseau/" target="_self"> http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Clouseau/</a><br /></p>
