<p>I've always been a fan of explicit, separate imports in Python, vs generic module imports. Maybe it's because I like things to be explicit, or I've been spoiled by the way Eclipse Pydev deals with auto-importing, but I have an aversion towards generic module imports. To keep the code style consistent, I even rewrite to this style any foreign code that ends up in my code.</p>
<p>Specifically, I'm talking about:</p>
<pre>from foo import Bar
Bar()</pre>
<p>vs</p>
<pre>import foo
foo.Bar()
</pre>
<p>Needless to say, I like the first style better.</p>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages for each of the above methods:</p>
<ul><li>general module imports demand less from the editor (the programmer needs to type less "import" lines and the editor doesn't need to be very much aware of Python - emacs and vim users will probably favor this style)</li><li>but it makes it hard sometimes to figure out where a module comes from. Example: you're deep down reading a module and you encounter a line referencing the component module. Now, where does that component module comes from? Could be both of the following imports:<br /></li></ul>
<pre>from zope.app import component
from zope import component</pre>
<p>Of course, some people sensed this problem and write code like:</p>
<pre>class MyView(object):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; template = zope.app.pagetemplate.ViewPageTemplateFile('template.pt')
</pre>
<p>But this code is hard to read, hard to write and is almost at the limit with the self-imposed line length of 80 characters, which means most of the times it needs to be broken in two lines.</p>
<p>Today I became aware of what I consider the biggest advantage of using specific import (from foo import Bar). Heavy refactoring, in the absence of a comprehensive test suite, is a lot easier! When starting the program, the imports will fail and you get an immediate pointer to where you need to make a fix. If I would have used a generic module import, the error will have appeared only when trying to use the piece of code that calls foo.Bar().</p>
<p>TL;DR: use specific imports! If your editor doesn't support it, take some time to look at Eclipse Pydev or Netbeans, two free IDEs with Python support. You'll get:</p>
<ul><li> easier refactoring <br /></li><li> better code legibility</li><li>I'll be happier when I need to reuse code snippets :-)<br /></li></ul>
