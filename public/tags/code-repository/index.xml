      <description>I&#39;ve just discovered (or rediscovered) some resources that I think are important enough to highlight here.
The Zope Corporation has several eggs that are not published in the svn.zope.org subversion repository, eggs located at download.zope.org. There are several very interesting packages there, including some to build an intranet. I&#39;ll definately have a look at them.I&#39;ve rediscovered OpenJSAN, a Javascript repository full of goodies.
And its really nice Planet Javascript
