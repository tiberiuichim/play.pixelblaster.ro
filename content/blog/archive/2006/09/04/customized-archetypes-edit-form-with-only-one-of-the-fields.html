<p>I recently had a need for an "administration screen" for an AT-based content that would give the administrators just one field to edit and following that edit, change the workflow state of that piece of content.</p><p>Usually, to limit the fields visible in the edit form, I would give those fields different write permissions. Obviously, in this case this was not possible, so I had to take another path. Easiest way to achieve my goal was something like this:</p><ul><li>Make a copy of the base_edit.cpt and its .metadata file and rename them to something like "workorder_schedule_edit.cpt"</li><li>Edit the new cpt file and change its edit body macro to something like:</li></ul><pre>        &lt;metal:body use-macro="body_macro" &gt;<br />          &lt;metal:block fill-slot="widgets"&gt;<br />            &lt;metal:fieldMacro use-macro="python:here.widget('end_date', mode='edit')" /&gt;<br />          &lt;/metal:block&gt;<br />        &lt;/metal:body&gt;</pre><ul><li>This would use the body defined in the edit_macros (follow the metal statements for details) and only show the 'end_date' field in the edit form.</li><li>Next, I've changed the metadata file to insert my cpy file there</li></ul><pre>[actions]<br />action.success = traverse_to:string:workorder_schedule_content_edit<br />action.success..form_add = traverse_to:string:add_reference<br />action.success..cancel = traverse_to:string:go_back<br />action.failure = traverse_to:string:workorder_schedule_edit</pre><p>From here onward things are easy. Add workorder_schedule_content_edit.cpy form controler script, and its metadata file to point back to the content_edit file.</p>
