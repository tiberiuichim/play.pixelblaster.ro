      <description>Managing the Footer as content is one of the common tasks on a Plone / Volto website. One typical approach is to designate some root folder, let&amp;rsquo;s say footer-links as a container for Link instances, and use those links as shortcuts to dedicated pages.
So, a footer component may look like this:
import React from &#39;react&#39;; import { getContent } from &#39;@plone/volto/actions&#39;; import { useSelector } from &#39;react-redux&#39;; import {UniversalLink} from &#39;@plone/volto/components&#39;; const Footer = () =&amp;gt; { const footerLinks = useSelector((state) =&amp;gt; state.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started working on a new Leaflet-powered Volto map block and the first thing that happened while loading react-leaftlet was an error reported by the browser:
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (10:41) in @react-leaflet/core/esm/path.js ... const options = props.pathOptions ?? {}; ...  The problem is that is, for some reasons, the transpiled JS bundle includes code using the nulish coalescing operator
This is already a problem reported in react-leaflet and it happens because the distributed transpiled library includes that code.</description>

      <description>Just some quick notes, in case this might help someone. After quite a bit of time and tests in trying to use asyncConnect to get data in a Volto component view (strictly focusing on the SSR side), I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do is not supported by the redux-connect library.
In Volto, right now there are two components that use asyncConnect: App.jsx and Search.jsx. The purpose of asyncConnect is to have the server side rendered page &amp;ldquo;dynamic&amp;rdquo;, depending on the input from the originating request.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a way to speedup Volto razzle/webpack builds, both while developing and for &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; mode, when building the final bundle. Fortunately, this solution exists and it&amp;rsquo;s extremely easy to integrate.
Let&amp;rsquo;s define the problem, to see how to approach it: what is Volto actually? What do you get when you open, in your browser, a Volto frontend Plone website? To greatly simplify (and I hope I didn&amp;rsquo;t get anything wrong as I am not a Volto core developer):</description>
