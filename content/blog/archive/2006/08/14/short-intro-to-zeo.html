<p>Joel Burton is holding ad-hoc tutorials on IRC :-)</p><p>Anyway, here's his recipe to running ZEO<br /></p><p>&lt;joelburton&gt; having your site running under zeo also allows you to "zopectl debug" it while it's still running, which is insanely useful. i _always_ run zope under zeo, even during development, even on my laptop, etc., and i recommend that to others.<br />&lt;joelburton&gt; thegoldenaura: zeo just splits zope-the-app-server and zope-the-database into two<br />&lt;joelburton&gt; the goldenaura: for small sites, where you expect to have just one zope server for your zeo server, i do it like this:<br />&lt;joelburton&gt; 1) use $ZOPE/bin/mkzeoinstance to make a zeo instance. for these small instances, i put it in $INSTANCE_HOME/zeo<br /> &lt;joelburton&gt; 2) stop your zope instance; move your Data.fs from $INSTANCE_HOME/var to $INSTANCE_HOME/zeo/var<br /> &lt;joelburton&gt; 3) edit your $INSTANCE_HOME/zope.conf to comment out the normal main storage, and ot use the ZEO storage (both at the bottom)<br /> &lt;joelburton&gt; 4) start up zeo and zope<br /></p>
