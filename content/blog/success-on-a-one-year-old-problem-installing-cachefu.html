<p>I've upgraded CacheFu (Products.CacheSetup) to the latest 1.2 for some of the websites that I manage, in a Plone 2.5 cluster. One of them had a problem that I haven't been able to track previously, due to limited time: on a reinstall of CacheSetup, due to product upgrades, CacheFu couldn't be installed anymore. The traceback was something like:</p>

<p>One other weird thing are the paths in this traceback: /home/zope/z29 doesn't exist anymore, the database was moved from a different server. I think it's related to the persistent product entries in the Control_Panels, which can be cleared. Not a big problem. In the log, there was also an entry related to this traceback:</p>
<pre>2009-02-28 17:01:18 CRITICAL txn.-1223480432 A storage error occurred during the second phase of the two-phase commit.  Resources may be in an inconsistent state
</pre>
<p>Now, the solution is really simple, but I needed to debug the policy_2 module to find this:&nbsp;</p>
<pre>rules.invokeFactory(id=id, type_name='PolicyHTTPCacheManagerCacheRule')</pre>
<p>didn't work because there was a document in the root called "rules". Nobody expects the spamish Acquisition! And I didn't either... Lesson? Zope 2 was designed to be too smart for its own good, thus violating the KISS principle. Still love it, though.</p>
