<p>Today I've wanted to change something in a trac instance I have setup for a project, when I thought: "I wish there was a way to do this from inside Eclipse". And there is! After a bit of searching (this information is available from the Trac site), I've discovered that Eclipse has a project that handles task based programming, project called <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/">Mylar</a>, which has a <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylar_Trac_Connector">Trac connector plugin</a> financed through a Google Summer of Code project. I've installed the XML-RPC interface plugin for Trac, connected it to Eclipse and I can now enjoy viewing, creating and editing tickets in my Eclipse.<br /></p>
