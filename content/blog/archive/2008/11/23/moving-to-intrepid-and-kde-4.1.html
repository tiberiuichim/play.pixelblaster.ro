<p><a title="KDE 4.1 screenshot" class="internal-link" href="../screenshot.png"><img class="image-right" src="../screenshot.png/image_preview" alt="KDE 4.1 screenshot" /></a>I've migrated my laptop (my main workstation, these days) and I've done
a complete migration to the KDE 4.1 desktop. Things are not perfect,
(on the old KDE 3.5 I'd say things were 99% according to my tastes),
but I'm trying to accomodate and find replacements. I didn't like the
KDE 4.1 launcher at first and I've even tested Launcelot for a while,
but now I'm back to the default menu and I'm starting to like it (on
3.5 I was using Tasty Menu).</p>
<p>I'm using Scultptura style with the Scultura-Stone color scheme and Sculptura window decoration. I needed to add another plasmoid from kde-look, the panel spacer, to make the systray smaller and separate the buttons on the right side to those on the left.</p>
<p>Things that I'm missing:</p>
<ul><li>no "window" list menu widget, which I've tried to replace with a plasmoid. I might as well remove it, because it doesn't list all the windows from all desktops, just the current desktop.</li><li>I don't like the double spacing of the clock &amp; date widget, I wish that it was a single line. I saw that there's a plasmoid on kde-look.org, I might try that.</li><li>I don't like the black background in the systray (at the right top)</li><li>There's no working "app shortcuts buttons" plasmoid, although I may try to simulate that with the Quick Access plasmoid.</li></ul>
<p>Things that I'm happy with:</p>
<ul><li>Shiny new software!</li><li>KDE 4.1 is actually not that horrible, once I tweak it (although Kde 3.5 had the same problem, closest to my "visual" tastes comes Gnome, but I like Kde applications better).</li><li>NetworkManager seems to deal a bit better with my wireless connection (when my girlfriend opens her Macbook I get terrible disconnects from the access point)</li></ul>
