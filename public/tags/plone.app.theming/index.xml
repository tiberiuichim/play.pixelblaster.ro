      <description>I&#39;m working on an (inherited) website that uses Plone and BackboneJS to offer a streamlined search interface over a catalog of items.
My task was to apply a new Diazo theme, which worked great for the rest of the website, except for this search page. The items inserted by the Backbone app would be all garbled and wrong. In the end, I managed to isolate the problem to a single page template that would load only that SPA, and the problem still persisted, (on my development machine), while the same code ran ok on the production server.</description>
