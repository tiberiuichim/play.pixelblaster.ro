<p>I've opened a new blog, at <a class="external-link" href="http://vimzone.pixelblaster.ro">http://vimzone.pixelblaster.ro</a> It runs on the latest Plone 3, with the NottreDamme skin and Scrawl as the blogging product. I'll probably install also the QuillsEnabled extension. There's not a lot of content on it, although it's already almost 2 months old. It's a place for me to scribble things I know about VIM and use or discover.</p>
