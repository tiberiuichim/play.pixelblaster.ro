<p>I'm in the process of beginning a new project and I'm debating on what framework to use. Of course it will be Zope 3, but why do I use it. Well, it's sure something that has to do with these facts:</p>
<ul><li>it's open source, with a strong, mature community around it</li><li>while it's still actively development, it has a stable API<br /></li></ul>
<ul><li>it's written in Python, one of the easiest and most powerful languages</li><li>it's built around a component architecture, which means writing pluggable applications comes naturally</li><li>solves the problem of publishing objects through the web</li><li>everything is transaction based. You won't lose data with it, you won't get garbage data inside your database</li><li>it has fast, configurable storages (ZODB, Relstorage)</li><li>internationalization and localization is easy</li><li>it's a library as much as it is an application server. When it's a library, it's very slim and as a full application server has a lot going on, including XMLRPC, ftp, webdav, sql connectivity, its own http server, etc.</li><li>has a cool, extensible templating language (the Zope Page Templates)<br /></li><li>makes it extremely easy to create and store objects through ZODB</li><li>has facilities to query for objects using indexed data, through zope.catalog and extensions</li><li>writing a new catalog index is not an extremely complex task</li><li>it has an event framework; no complex application should run without an event framework</li><li>has advanced, flexible form libraries that can generate forms introspected from the models (zope.formlib, z3c.form)</li><li>has advanced templating concepts and content placement, such as the pagelets and viewlets</li><li>it's "enterprise ready": it's possible to load balance zope clients using ZEO or relstorage</li><li>comes with extensible authentication and user sources<br /></li><li>promotes an extensible build system for applications (zc.buildout)</li><li>follows python standards, for the most part: library packaged as independent eggs and while it's not built around WSGI, it has full support for it</li><li>it can do document workflows (hurry.workflow)<br /></li><li>it has some very cool packages from the community:</li>
<ul><li>zc.table</li><li>z3c.form</li><li>Storm and sqlalchemy wrappers</li><li>zc.resourcelibrary, z3c.resourceinclude</li><li>z3c.pagelet</li><li>lovely.remotetask</li><li>grok</li><li>gocept.registration</li><li>z3c.traverser<br /></li></ul>
</ul>
<ul><li>is very well documented</li><li>it fits comfortably in my brain</li></ul>
