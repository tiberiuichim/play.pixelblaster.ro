<p>I've been playing in my mind, for the last two days, for no apparent reason, "Birds of a feather" by Phish. I even asked myself at one point what's with theÂ  song that keeps appearing in my mind. Well, I think I found the reason. For the last two days, the first portlet on my customized slashdot homepage was KDENews, which had a news item on a "Birds of a Feather" KDE event. The weird thing is that I didn't consciously made the connection with the song, but every time I visited the slashdot page, I got the song in the back of my mind. No wonder the stupid commercials work most of the time... <br /></p>
