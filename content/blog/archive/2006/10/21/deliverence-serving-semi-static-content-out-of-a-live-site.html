<p><i>Deliverance is a lightweight, semi-static system for content delivery of CMS resources.  It runs in mod_python, generating branded pages and navigation elements, giving high-performance throughput to anonymous visitors.</i></p><p>Sounds interesting, especially in light of my contact with owners of bigger sites and editorial staff.<br /></p><p>This product can be downloaded from <a href="http://codespeak.net/svn/z3/deliverance/" target="_self">http://codespeak.net/svn/z3/deliverance/</a><br /></p>
