<p>I thought I'd put a link here for a source of great entertainment of mine: <a href="http://www.hoodyhoo.com/kodt.htm">The Knights of the Dinner Table</a>. Hope you'll be as entertained as I am every time I'm watching them or reading the KODT comic strip.</p><p>And another link: <a href="http://dwarfstar.brainiac.com/ds_barbarianprince.html">Barbarian Prince</a>, a downloadable solitaire game, a mixture of boardgame/RPG/choose your own adventure. I found a review of this game in the KODT comics magazine, but there are a couple of other games there, for two players or solitaire.<br /></p>
