I'm not a GFX or 3d programmer, but looking at this <a href="http://zrusin.blogspot.com/2007/05/mesa-and-llvm.html">blog entry</a>, I understand that these guys are getting ready a way to run Python based software in the GPU. I wonder what kind of speed improvements can be achieved through that, although I fear that it's only going to work for numeric type of programs.<br />
