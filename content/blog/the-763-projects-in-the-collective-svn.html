<p>Today I was curious about the number of projects found in the collective svn. They always seemed a lot, but I never knew how many. Until today, when I ran a xpath query over the subversion page and I found that there are 763! This number shocked me, I was expecting at most 200. My number of projects there is very small though, I can only claim ownership over 2 of them.<br /></p>
