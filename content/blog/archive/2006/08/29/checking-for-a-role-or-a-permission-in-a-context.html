<p>There are two very useful methods to check for certain security settings offered by the Plone API. First, to check if a user has a certain role, the following snippet can be used:<br /></p><pre>roles_user_has = portal_membership.getCandidateLocalRoles(here)</pre><p>To check if a user has a certain permission, this API method can be used:<br /></p><pre>portal_membership.checkPermission('Manage portal', here)</pre>
