<p>I'm importing content from a legacy system to a new website that I'm doing with Plone 4 (wow! what an improvement, in speed and technology) and was looking at the existing documentation on how to programatically create new Plone content. The issue I'm having with the <a class="external-link" href="http://plone.org/documentation/kb/add-content-programmatically">existing documentation</a> is that it's incomplete. It won't give you automatically created ids, you'll have to manually call mutators if you don't know any better, etc.</p>
<p>This is what I have come up with (this code runs in a browser view):</p>
<pre>_id = self.context.generateUniqueId("Document")
_id = self.context.invokeFactory(type_name=type_name, id=_id)
ob = self.context[_id]
ob.edit(
     description = "text...",
     subject     = ('tag1', 'tag2'),
     title       = "some title...",
&nbsp;)
ob._renameAfterCreation(check_auto_id=True)
_id = ob.getId()
</pre>
<p>One thing I notice is that Plone 4 starts faster, comes with easily pluggable developer tools, and in general feels a lot more polished then any previous Plone releases. It's a good system to work with.</p>
