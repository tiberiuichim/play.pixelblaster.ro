<p>I've hit the setuptools + subversion 1.5 problem again with a freshly install Plone 3.1.7 buildout: I've added my egg develop folder in zinstance/src/, I've added the egg in the relevant sections in buildout.cfg, but it wouldn't work because of the incompatibility with the old setuptools version.</p>
<p>The solution is to upgrade the installed setuptools to the latest version. For example, for a standalone Plone installed at /home/tibi/Plone, we have this structure:</p>
<pre>/home/tibi/Plone
&nbsp;&nbsp; /Python-2.4
&nbsp;&nbsp; /buildout-cache
&nbsp;&nbsp; /zinstance</pre>
<p>I've changed directory to the Python-2.4 from above and ran:</p>
<pre>bin/easy_install -U setuptools</pre>
<p>Then I could succesfully run the buildout in the zinstance folder.</p>
