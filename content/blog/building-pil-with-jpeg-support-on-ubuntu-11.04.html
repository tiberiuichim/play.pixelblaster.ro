<p>I had problems building PIL with jpeg support on the latest Ubuntu. There are now two libjpeg libraries: one called libjpeg62 and one libjpeg8. Every guide on the net explaining how to compile PIL with jpeg support points to installing libjpeg62-dev. Needless to say, libjpeg8-dev is actually needed to properly build PIL. My reason for initially avoiding libjpeg8 is that it causes libsdlimage-dev to be uninstalled, so it looks like I'll have to juggle packages whenever I want to compile something that requires SDL.</p>
