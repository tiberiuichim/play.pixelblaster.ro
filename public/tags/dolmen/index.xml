      <description>I&#39;m finally starting a long-overdue project which I have decided to do with Dolmen. As usual, I start by studying its source code and the packages that are available for it. By itself it can will get me about 60% with the requirements for my project, so it&#39;s a pretty good starting base. I plan to also study and use some of the menhir.* packages, which are pretty good as generic CMS content types.</description>
