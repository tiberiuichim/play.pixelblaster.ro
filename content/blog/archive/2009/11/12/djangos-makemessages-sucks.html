<p>Yet another angry rant, caused, of course, by using Django in anger. Nothing wrong with using something in anger, that's the real way I learn something. Zope 3 even has an online book on how to use it in anger.</p>
<p>That said, Django's makemessages administrative command sucks by being way too inflexible to anything but the ideal Django development environment. My environment looks like this: I have a project based on Pinax, which I'm developing and deploying using zc.buildout. My source code sits in src, where I have several packages. I also have a "localsettings.py" module located in the root of the buildout, because I don't want to have it inside the src folder. Pinax is located in parts/Pinax, and it's actually a git checkout, based on my own fork of Pinax. Pinax doesn't have translations at the moment (I think I saw a ticket in its tracker about reintroducing a translation package), so I'm on my own here with regards to translation.</p>
<p>With this setup, it is close to impossible for me to generate anything useful without a lot of hacking and swearing. Makemessages insists on being run from inside a Django project, and when I did that, it complains about missing localsettings module. Pointing the root of the buildout as pythonpath didn't do anything. A good thing that I have already extracted messages from the templates, before switching to the buildout project structure.</p>
<p>Some solutions that I have found:</p>
<ul><li>I can extract messages from the Pinax python modules using this homegrown script:<br /></li></ul>
<pre>PYFILES=/tmp/pyfiles
PINAX=parts/Pinax/pinax/ 
BASE=/home/tibi/work/ProjectBuildout/src/project/locale/ro/LC_MESSAGES/
POTFILE_PYTHON=$BASE/python.pot
POTFILE_TEMPLATES=$BASE/templates.pot
POTFILE=$BASE/django.pot
POFILE=$BASE/django.po

#extract messages from python code
find $PINAX | grep ".*py$" &gt; /tmp/pyfiles
touch $POTFILE_PYTHON
xgettext -j -L python -d django -f $PYFILES -o $POTFILE_PYTHON

#merge the templates + python messages into one pot file
msgcat -o $POTFILE $POTFILE_TEMPLATES $POTFILE_PYTHON

#merge the potfile with the po file
msgmerge -U -N $POFILE $POTFILE</pre>
<ul><li>I have copied all the templates from pinax and its associated applications inside a template folder in my project. Now I can generate the po file, from my src/project folder, with</li></ul>
<pre>../../bin/py ./../../manage.py makemessages -e .py -e .html -l ro
</pre>
<p>Of course, I can't run this over the other apps and packages in my src/ folder to extract messages from the python modules, so I am forced to adjust the first script to take those folders into consideration.</p>
