<p>I've just discovered (or rediscovered) some resources that I think are important enough to highlight here.</p><ul><li>The Zope Corporation has several eggs that are not published in the svn.zope.org subversion repository, eggs located at <a href="http://download.zope.org">download.zope.org</a>. There are several very interesting packages there, including some to build an intranet. I'll definately have a look at them.</li><li>I've rediscovered <a href="http://openjsan.org/">OpenJSAN</a>, a Javascript repository full of goodies.<br /></li><li>And its really nice <a href="http://planet.openjsan.org/">Planet Javascript</a><br /></li></ul>
