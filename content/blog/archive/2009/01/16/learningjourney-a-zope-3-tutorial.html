<p>Last year, in December, I held a 3 day Zope 3 training for about 10 Zope 2 and Python programmers. For this training I had prepared a 50 pages booklet with some tutorials and reference information (most of it written by me especially for this occasion). The feedback was pretty positive, but only time will tell if I was succesful or not with my training.</p>
<p>I have published the training material on Google Code in a project called <a class="external-link" href="http://code.google.com/p/z3ergo/">z3ergo</a>. My intention is to publish there more packages and tutorials, as they come. The beef of the tutorial was a simple but complete application called <a class="external-link" href="http://code.google.com/p/z3ergo/source/browse/#svn/LearningJourney">LearningJourney</a>. My initial intention was to have an application where students could enter a log of the things that they learn, but it could be thought as a simple blog system as well. This is a <a class="external-link" href="http://code.google.com/p/z3ergo/source/browse/#svn/LearningJourney">full Zope 3 tutorial application, complete with a site, skin and registration process</a>. I hope somebody can find it useful. The leaflet is published there in two languages (<a class="external-link" href="http://code.google.com/p/z3ergo/source/browse/LearningJourney/LearningJourney-AZope3Introduction-en.pdf">English</a> and <a class="external-link" href="http://code.google.com/p/z3ergo/source/browse/LearningJourney/LearningJourney-AZope3Introduction-ro.pdf">Romanian</a>), in pdf format. You can find the source code for the docs in the <a class="external-link" href="http://code.google.com/p/z3ergo/source/browse/#svn/LearningJourney/docs/source">LearningJourney docs </a>folder.</p>
<p>The materials cover a lot of the Zope 3 landscape, as this training was for knowledgeable Zope 2/Plone programmers who were evaluating Zope 3 and also had access to other Zope 3 docs, such as <a class="external-link" href="http://worldcookery.com">Philipp's Zope 3 book</a>. Keep this in mind when going through the docs and wonder why they're so slim.</p>
<p>The training itself was pretty non-formal. I've used the booklet and the sourcecode to guide them through what a Zope 3 application means. There were a lot of questions (practically, the training flow was more question based, with just a few interventions from me to guide it to a different direction), but many things that were covered mostly at surface. We didn't have any practical exercises, although I wish I was able to have them, it might have helped the students feel a little bit less lost. A more structured approach could have helped as well, who knows. It was both tiring and fun and I got to meet lots of cool people, with which I will hopefull colaborate in the future.</p>
<p>If there's an interest in getting more out of these docs, or you might need me as a Zope 3 trainer, feel free to contact me using this site's contact form.</p>
