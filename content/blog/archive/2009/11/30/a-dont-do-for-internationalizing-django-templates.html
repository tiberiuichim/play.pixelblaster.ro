<p>I'm internationalizing a Pinax website and I've encountered this piece of code in a template:</p>
<pre>&lt;input type="submit" value="{% trans "invite" %}"/&gt;
{% blocktrans %}{{ other_user }} to be a friend.{% endblocktrans %}
</pre>
<p>The message ids for this code would be two separate blocks: "invite" and " %{other_user}s to be a friend". Both offer very little in terms of context and make the translators job difficult. Correct, in my point of view, would be the more convoluted form of:</p>
<pre>{% blocktrans %}
&lt;input type="submit" value="invite"/&gt;
{{ other_user }} to be a friend.
{%&nbsp; endblocktrans %}
</pre>
<p>This implies that the translators know enough HTML to notice that the value attribute needs to be translated, but the end result is a lot more flexible and provides real context to them.</p>
<p>TL;DR: don't split paragraphs into separate translation units. It's a NO-NO.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I have found what is probably the worst example of how to create a translatable template. Remember, don't assume the English language resembles anything like another language.</p>
<pre>{% trans "edited by user" %} {{ obj.editor.username }} {% trans "at"%} {{ obj.modified|date:"H:i" }}
</pre>
<p>This should be done this way:</p>
<pre>{% blocktrans with obj.editor.username as editor_username and obj.modified|date:"H:i" as obj_modified
edited by user {{ editor_username }} at {{ obj_modified }}
{% endblocktrans %}
</pre>
