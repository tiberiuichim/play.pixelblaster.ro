<p>I've stumbled on this error when trying to install a easyshop buildout:<br /></p>
<pre>Exception: No SSL support found<br />An error occured when trying to install ssl-for-setuptools 1.10.Look above this message for any errors thatwere output by easy_install.<br />While:<br />  Installing instance.<br />  Getting distribution for 'ssl-for-setuptools'.<br />Error: Couldn't install: ssl-for-setuptools 1.10<br /></pre>
<p>After scratching my head for a while, I've found the solution:</p>
<pre># apt-get install libssl-dev</pre>
