<p>I wonder what possible explanation there is for the behaviour of the date template filter.</p>
<pre>Uses the same format as PHP's date() function (http://php.net/date) with some custom extensions.
</pre>
<p>I understand where Django comes from, but I think this sort of things should be more aligned with the rest of the Python world.</p>
