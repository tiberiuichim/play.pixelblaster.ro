<p>For some reason, the TTW developer tools tend to get neglected in the Plone world. A valuable tools such as Clouseau has fallen out of favour and now Gloworm, the @@manage-viewlets replacement/complement won't run in Plone 4 (at least at version 1.0, which is the latest right now on PyPI).</p>
<p>Fortunately, Gloworm has been updated in svn trunk. To get the latest version you need to add it to sources (in buildout.cfg or develop.cfg):</p>
<pre>[buildout]
eggs +=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Products.Gloworm

[sources]
Products.Gloworm = svn https://weblion.psu.edu/svn/weblion/weblion/Products.Gloworm/trunk/
</pre>
<p>Next, run in the shell:</p>
<pre>#bin/develop co Products.Gloworm
#bin/develop rb
</pre>
