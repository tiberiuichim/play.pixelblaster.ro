<p>Sometimes you have code that has a lot of print statements, which are helping you with debugging. But what happens if you try to port that code to an environment without a console? In the best case, you won't see the prints anymore, in the worse case, the code will fail because there's no "valid file descriptor" to which to write.</p><p>The solution to this problem is to replace python's stdout file, which will enable the code output to be recorded and maybe logged for debugging purposes.</p><p>The following snippet shows how to achieve this:</p><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; import StringIO, sys<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; out = StringIO.StringIO()<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.stdout = out<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; print "Test"<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; log = out.getvalue()<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; assert (log == "Test\n")<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /></pre><p><br /></p>
