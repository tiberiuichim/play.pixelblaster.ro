<p>To get an object completely stripped of its acquisition layers, the following snippet can be employed</p><pre>import Acquisition<br />obj_no_aq = Acquisition.aq_base(obj)<br /></pre><p>No acquisition means no methods or properties inherited from the container or the container chain.</p><p>Although a bit old, the <a href="http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Books/ZDG/" target="_self">Zope Developer Guide</a>, with its chapter on <a href="http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Books/ZDG/current/Acquisition.stx" target="_self">Acquisition</a> do a fine job at explaining the intricacies of acquisition in Zope 2.<br /></p>
