<p>I have a Zope product that needs to write in a centralized location, across multiple instances. The classic Python solution would be to write a variable in a config.py module and read that location from the code, but this feels unelegant in an environment that uses zc.buildout for deployment. The solution I have found is, as follows:</p>
<p>In buildout.cfg, in the instance part definition, add:</p>
<pre>zope-conf-additional =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;environment&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mylocation ${buildout:directory}/var/mylocation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/environment&gt;
</pre>
<p>Next, inside the product code I have:</p>
<pre>from App.config import getConfiguration
import os

conf = getConfiguration()
dest = conf.environment['mylocation']
if not os.path.exists(dest):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; os.mkdir(dest)</pre>
<p>There were 2 things that I had to research for this task: reading the global zope configuration (that's done with App.config.getConfiguration()) and the fact that you can't add arbitrary key/values in zope.conf and have to use the &lt;environment&gt; section.</p>
