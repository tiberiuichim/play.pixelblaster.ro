      <description>I think this is the Python Index biggest mistake, the one which makes it unreliable for serious development environments: exposing package entries with no real package files and just a download URL. To see what I&#39;m talking about, just examine the PyPI records for BeautifulSoup or IPython, packages that are very common in buildouts. As soon as the author and publisher of that package has a hosting problem, the developer that uses that package also has a problem.</description>
