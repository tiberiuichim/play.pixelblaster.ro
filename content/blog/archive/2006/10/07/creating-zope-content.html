<p>I had a need to create new external methods on install of a product. So, even if technique is old and well know to any Zope 2 old-timer, I'm placing this here for my own reference.</p><pre>def install(portal):<br />    portal.manage_addProduct['ExternalMethod'].manage_addExternalMethod(<br />        id = 'emailMe',<br />        title='emailMe',<br />        module='MyProduct.emailMe',<br />        function='emailMe')</pre><p>The code needs to interact with a legacy module (renamed here emailMe). The idea is that manage_addProduct returns a dictionary of factories and manage_addExternalMethod is the factory method defined in the ExternalMethod module. Most of the old style Zope content can be added this way.<br /></p>
