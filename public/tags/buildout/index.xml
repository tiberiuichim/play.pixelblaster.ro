      <description>I&#39;ve recently had to integrate a script/package into a Plone 2.5 buildout that runs on top of Python 2.4. Due to that package&#39;s dependence of a sane imaplib (and the one in Python 2.4 is buggy), I had to run the script with python2.6. To make a script run on a different python, you need to do:
[myscript] recipe = zc.regipe.egg eggs = &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; myegg &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; IMAPClient python = python26 The python26 option is actually the name of a buildout part that configures the python executable path</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve had a buildout bootstrap process failure, this time a weird one, perhaps I should document the bug and report it.
The latest Ubuntu version which I have installed (Lucid Lynx) comes with a package called python-pkg-resources, which packages pkg_resources, which used to be available only through the setuptools distribution. Buildout&#39;s bootstrap.py tries to guess if Setuptools or Distribute are installed by checking the availability of pkg_resources; by guessing wrong it all comes to a crash at the end.</description>

      <title>Dear PyPi uploaders: don&#39;t use a download URL, upload your package instead!</title>

      <description>I think this is the Python Index biggest mistake, the one which makes it unreliable for serious development environments: exposing package entries with no real package files and just a download URL. To see what I&#39;m talking about, just examine the PyPI records for BeautifulSoup or IPython, packages that are very common in buildouts. As soon as the author and publisher of that package has a hosting problem, the developer that uses that package also has a problem.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve hit the setuptools + subversion 1.5 problem again with a freshly install Plone 3.1.7 buildout: I&#39;ve added my egg develop folder in zinstance/src/, I&#39;ve added the egg in the relevant sections in buildout.cfg, but it wouldn&#39;t work because of the incompatibility with the old setuptools version.
The solution is to upgrade the installed setuptools to the latest version. For example, for a standalone Plone installed at /home/tibi/Plone, we have this structure:</description>
