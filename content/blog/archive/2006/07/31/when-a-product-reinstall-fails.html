<p>It happened to me several times, and I always forget what the problem is. Sometimes a product reinstall (from QuickInstaller) fails with an odd error: AttributeError: manage_addTool.Â  This only means that the product is broken. Make a visit to the Zope Control Panel \ Products and look in the refresh page for the product on the real reason why it fails.<br /></p>
