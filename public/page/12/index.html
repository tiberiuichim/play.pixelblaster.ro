        <p class="discreet">Problem: I need to get the skin name for a Zope 3 interface registered as skin.
Solution
Starting with Zope 3.3, the skinning mechanism has been simplified and skins are now just interfaces. This means that a skin interface is now a named utility for the IBrowserSkinType. To get the name with which this class has been registered as an utility, something along these lines is needed:
&gt;&gt;&gt; from myapp.layer import IMyAppSkin [...]</p>

        <p class="discreet">I've recently "rediscovered" Freeciv. I'm a very casual gamer (15 minutes/day), but also an old, addicted, Civilization fan. Lately I've been looking for a nice game to play on my Linux desktops and I've found that Freeciv is finally getting some good graphics, as this was my biggest turn off I've had with it before. I've tried first the SDL client on Windows, but it is buggy and tends to freeze its popup windows. [...]</p>

        <p class="discreet">I've got to deploy a new desktop based application, created, of course, with Zope 3. When you've got a hammer, everything looks like a nail, indeed. This application uses HTML and CSS as its presentation layer (right, it's a web page), with a bit of Ajax thrown in. Due do time constraints, I'm not even trying to get it to work properly on Internet Explorer (although it looks about 90% right, but I have some problems with Javascript), so I won't be embeding the Internet Explorer this time engine in my Python application, I'll just try to get the Gecko rendering engine, the one used in Firefox.

        <p class="discreet">I've finally got tired of writing small fragments of JavaScript code and views to be able to make different areas updatable through ajax for my current Zope 3 application. Plus, when I've started writing this application, I've started doing the layout with viewlets and managers, and it seems that for each viewlet that I'm creating I have to have a way to get its content through AJAX, which means having a page available for it, and this is very odd, as it almost defeats the point of having viewlets.

What I don't enjoy is the forest of non-alphanumeric characters that has started to clog my code.

Now things have really started to fly. Before I only had 512 MB of RAM (which had to be shared with the onboard video card), but now I have a really cool 1.5 GB of RAM.

The Zope Corporation has several eggs that are not published in the svn.zope.org subversion repository, eggs located at download.zope.org. There are several very interesting packages there, including some to build an intranet. I'll definately have a look at them.I've rediscovered OpenJSAN, a Javascript repository full of goodies.

Trying to get the macros with something like context/@@page_with_macros/macros/the_macro doesn't work, as BrowserView (and BrowserPage) doesn't know anything about Zope Page Templates. Of course, that's also because Zope 3 doesn't directly publishes templates, only pages. [...]</p>
