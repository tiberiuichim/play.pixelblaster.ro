<p>This may be basic trick for some, a non-obvious usage of views for others, who knows, I'm documenting it here anyway. I've been using this technique for quite some time without giving it much thought.</p>
<p>There are times when I have an object in a template. I want to display information associated with that object. This information is already coded in a @@detail view on this object. Suppose this example (in mostly pseudocode):</p>
<pre>class PersonDetail(BrowserView):
    """Show detail about a person"""
    def name(self):
        return compute_somehow_name()

class CommentDetail(BrowserView):
    """Show details about a comment"""
</pre>
<p>Now we have the following template for the CommentDetail view:</p>
<pre>&lt;div tal:define='person comment/author; person_info nocall:person/@@detail'&gt;
    &lt;a tal:attributes="href person/@@absolute_url" tal:content="person_info/name"&gt;The author&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>Notice the nocall: keyword placed in from of the person/@@detail call. This ensures that the @@detail view is instantiated, but not called (so it is not rendered). This way we have access to the view class attributes, properly associated to the Person context.</p>
