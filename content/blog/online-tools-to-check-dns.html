<p>Every now and then I need to check the dns settings for some servers that I look after. Not being an expert, I use these two sites frequently to check that I'm not doing anything stupid:<br /></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.dnsreport.com" target="_self">http://www.dnsstuff.com/</a></li><li><a href="http://www.dnsreport.com" target="_self">http://www.dnsreport.com</a><br /></li></ul><p>My preferate is dnsreport.com, but I always forget its name and its pagerank on google is not too high. So I'm doing my really really tiny bit in lifting up its page rank by linking to it on this page.<br /></p>
