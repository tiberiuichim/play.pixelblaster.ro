<p>I needed to migrate a Kotti database, from its default sqlite file store, to Postgresql. Clued in by StackOverflow, I've tried using <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader">pgloader</a>, but the version coming with Ubuntu is old: 2.x instead of the brand new 3.x. But the jump to 3.x meant a switch in programming languages as well: the new one is written in Lisp. I didn't want to install and compile the whole Lisp bundle just to run pgloader and I didn't find a binary distribution either, and after a recent exposure to Docker, I thought I'll give the dockerized version of pgloader a try.</p>
<p>After following the steps to <a class="external-link" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/">install Docker</a>, took me a bit to figure out the process (note: I'm running all this in a VMWare virtual machine, so I can afford taking a lot of unsecure shortcuts):</p>
<p>First, the local Postgresql database needs to be configured to run on an IP, to allow the dockerized pgloader process to connect to it.</p>
<pre>sudo vim &nbsp;/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf</pre>
<p>Change the network settings to allow connections from all:</p>
<pre># IPv4 local connections:
host &nbsp; &nbsp;all &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; all &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0.0.0/0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; md5</pre>
<div>Also, we will need to enable listening on TCP connections:</div>
<pre>sudo vim &nbsp;/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql.conf</pre>
<div>and add a listen_addresses line</div>
<pre>listen_addresses = '*'<span class="Apple-tab-span">		</span># what IP address(es) to listen on;</pre>
<div>Install Dockerized pgloader according to instructions:</div>
<pre><code>docker pull dimitri/pgloader</code></pre>
<p>I've created a file named "convert" with the commands for pgloader, to do the conversion:</p>
<pre>load database  
    from 'mydb.db'  
    into postgresql://user:password@192.168.1.20/mydb

with reset sequences, create no tables, include no drop, create no indexes, disable triggers
set work_mem to '200MB', maintenance_work_mem to '512 MB';</pre>
<p>For the IP of the postgresql I've used the one attached to eth0.</p>
<div>Because I didn't trust pgloader to convert all the nuances of the database relations, before running the conversion, I've started once Kotti, bin/pserve app.ini so that it will create the initial database structure. After that, truncated the nodes table so that it will erase most of the database content:</div>
<pre>psql mydb
truncate table nodes cascade
truncate table nodes principals</pre>
<div>Now, the trick is to put this 'convert' file, together with the 'mydb.db' sqlite file in the same folder and map that folder as a volume when running the pgloader command:</div>
<pre>sudo docker run --rm --name pgloader -v /path/to/data/:/data dimitri/pgloader:latest pgloader /data/convert</pre>
