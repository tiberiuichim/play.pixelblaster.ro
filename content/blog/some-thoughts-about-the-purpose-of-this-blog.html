<p>I've been thinking lately at the purpose of this blog, what it wants to be, what is really a blog and what I should write here. The number of posts have gone down in the last half of year, partly due to increased work load and partly due to some restructuring that I have done. <br /></p><p>In general, I'm unhappy about posting small tips and bits of information on the blog, that's why I have created a Tips &amp; Tutorials section on this site. I have copied or moved a lot of the content from the blog to this section and I'm also adding new stuff. I'll write new entries in the blog if there's anything worth noticing that I add there. At the moment, my "masterpiece" is an index of the packages available on svn.zope.org, done as an exercise in learning about the available extensions but also to provide a needed resource. <br /></p><p>I'm also planning on writing a complete series of Zope 3 beginner to advanced tutorials, for which I already have the code and module outlines and only need to put them together.<br /></p>
