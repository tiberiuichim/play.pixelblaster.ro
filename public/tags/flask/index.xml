      <description>Thanks to the wonders of WSGI and well behaved frameworks, it is now trivial to mix and match applications and have them run in the same Python process.
Normally, in a production scenario, uwsgi would be used to split and map the URL spaces to different apps, but for development it is simpler to just use good old PythonPaste. In my case, I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to have the RQ Dashboard (which is based on Flask) integrated with a Pyramid app that I&amp;rsquo;m working on.</description>
