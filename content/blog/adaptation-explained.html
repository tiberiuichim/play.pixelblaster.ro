<p>It seems that there's a proposal to introduce adaptation in Python 3000, which sparked a <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-April/000267.html" target="_self">discussion and a nice introduction to adaptation </a>on the <a href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-3000" target="_self">python-dev</a> list. Another explanation <a href="http://www.plope.com/Members/chrism/adaptation_for_busy_people" target="_self">here</a>.<br /></p>
