      <description>I&#39;m finally starting a long-overdue project which I have decided to do with Dolmen. As usual, I start by studying its source code and the packages that are available for it. By itself it can will get me about 60% with the requirements for my project, so it&#39;s a pretty good starting base. I plan to also study and use some of the menhir.* packages, which are pretty good as generic CMS content types.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve started an application that uses Dolmen, a lightweight CMS built on top of Grok, and I want to be able to &#34;rollup&#34; the megrok.resource files based on the devmode setting that was set in the zope.conf file. After a bit of digging, I came up with this code that tells me the current devmode setting for the running instance:
from zope.app.applicationcontrol.applicationcontrol import applicationController from zope.app.applicationcontrol.interfaces import IRuntimeInfo def get_debug_mode(): &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#34;</description>
