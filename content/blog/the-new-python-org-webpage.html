<p>When it first appeared, I said "heh", but now I don't like the new python.org webpage. The new page certainly looks a lot more 'designed', but the old one was certainly cute, and had the classic python logo. Where's that lovely snake? My concern is the overall feel of the page, not its content or internal organization. The present colors are too "4 years ago", I especially hate that blueish color. I think RoR is a nice page in terms of overall feel and colors, although I don't like to scroll so much on the page to find relevant links. Profesional pages don't have to be so cold in terms of used colors.<br /></p>
