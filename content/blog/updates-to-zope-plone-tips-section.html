<p>I've updated the <a title="Zope &amp; Plone tips" href="../../../../../zope-plone-tips">Zope &amp; Plone tips and tutorials section</a> with a bunch of new pages and several additions to the svn.zope.org package listing. I thought it might be interesting to highlight this here, I'm not exactly sure how visible (or interesting!) is that section to the readers of this blog.<br /></p>
