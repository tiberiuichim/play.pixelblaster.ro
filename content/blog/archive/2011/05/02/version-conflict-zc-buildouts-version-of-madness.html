<p>I'm not even trying to understand what happens, because it's aggravating to see buildouts fail like this:</p>
<pre>While:
&nbsp; Installing.
&nbsp; Getting section zope2.
&nbsp; Initializing section zope2.
&nbsp; Installing recipe plone.recipe.zope2install.
Error: There is a version conflict.
We already have: setuptools 0.6c9</pre>
<p>or, worse, this:</p>
<pre>While:
&nbsp; Installing.
&nbsp; Getting section zope2.
&nbsp; Initializing section zope2.
&nbsp; Installing recipe plone.recipe.zope2install.
Error: There is a version conflict.
We already have: zc.buildout 1.5.2</pre>
<p>Well, technically I know what happens: for example, zc.buildout is latest 2.0a1 now, but I've already installed 1.5.2 in my virtualenv (the bootstrap process failed hard, there are a tons of bugs there, I've had more failures in bootstrap then success, lately) and I had one product in my buildout which depended on zc.buildout, so it tried to pull the latest, only to get a version conflict.</p>
<p>I wish zc.buildout would behave more inteligently. Even specifying&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="literal-block">prefer-final = true<br /></pre>
<p>didn't do much to solve my problems. The only way to solve the problem was to add the following to the buildout.cfg file:</p>
<pre>[buildout]
...
versions = versions

[versions]
zc.buildout =1.5.2
setuptools = 0.6c9

</pre>
<p>UPDATE: a better solution is to have:</p>
<pre>[versions]
zc.buildout =
setuptools =</pre>
