<p>I may sound like a fanboy or something, but I'm starting to think that it's impossible to have a perfect piece of software, especially with larger systems. Two things that happened to me lately that made me think this:</p><ul><li>How lame is that Windows doesn't automount USB sticks when they're present at boot time? Why would I have to remove+reinsert the stick just so Windows will see the bloody thing? My Kubuntu, of course, handles perfectly everything in this department (at least in my case).</li><li>How lame is that <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org">Prototype</a> handles in a really stupid way forms that have multiple submit buttons and are submitted through Ajax? Not even Form.request() will do the proper thing, which is to only leave one of the submit inputs in the stream, the one that has been clicked on. The problem is with zope.formlib, which gets the action and the validation from the submit button that was pressed. More then one submit input in the request and things become uncontrollable. <br />To fix this I have added the following onsubmit handler to my Javascript code:</li></ul><pre>my_form.onsubmit = function(event){<br />    button = document.activeElement || event.explicitOriginalTarget;    // IE, Mozilla, Opera<br />    this.getInputs('submit').each(function(el){<br />          if (el.name != button.name) {<br />                el.disable();<br />          } <br />    }<br />}</pre><p>This disables all the submit input controls before serializing the form and doing an ajax request with Form.request(), as disabled inputs are ignored by serialize().</p><p>UPDATE: I am told that Prototype 1.6 will support multiple submit buttons. </p>
