      <description>Managing the Footer as content is one of the common tasks on a Plone / Volto website. One typical approach is to designate some root folder, let&amp;rsquo;s say footer-links as a container for Link instances, and use those links as shortcuts to dedicated pages.
So, a footer component may look like this:
import React from &#39;react&#39;; import { getContent } from &#39;@plone/volto/actions&#39;; import { useSelector } from &#39;react-redux&#39;; import {UniversalLink} from &#39;@plone/volto/components&#39;; const Footer = () =&amp;gt; { const footerLinks = useSelector((state) =&amp;gt; state.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started working on a new Leaflet-powered Volto map block and the first thing that happened while loading react-leaftlet was an error reported by the browser:
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (10:41) in @react-leaflet/core/esm/path.js ... const options = props.pathOptions ?? {}; ...  The problem is that is, for some reasons, the transpiled JS bundle includes code using the nulish coalescing operator
This is already a problem reported in react-leaflet and it happens because the distributed transpiled library includes that code.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a way to speedup Volto razzle/webpack builds, both while developing and for &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; mode, when building the final bundle. Fortunately, this solution exists and it&amp;rsquo;s extremely easy to integrate.
Let&amp;rsquo;s define the problem, to see how to approach it: what is Volto actually? What do you get when you open, in your browser, a Volto frontend Plone website? To greatly simplify (and I hope I didn&amp;rsquo;t get anything wrong as I am not a Volto core developer):</description>

      <description>Inspired by Pyramid&amp;rsquo;s and venusian&amp;rsquo;s scan() call, I&amp;rsquo;ve reimplemented an auto-discovery system for plugins. The problem is simple.
Suppose we want to &amp;ldquo;register&amp;rdquo; a series of functions that can run automatically, based on aspects set in the calling environment. The simples and easiest solution is something like:
# in some module, as a global declaration: from somethingA import runner_A from somethingB import runner_B runners = [ runner_A, runner_B ] # then, maybe in some function: def main(): # .</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve removed plone.app.stagingbehavior from a website because the new plone.app.iterate has the same functionality. In addition, the p.a.s package was overriding adapters that I wanted to write.
Now, my problem was that I could no longer save any related items, I would get an error:

      <description>One of the bigger annoyances when it comes to bigger application stacks (such as the typical Plone/Zope) is dealing with cron jobs and, in general, async tasks. The problem is that of the number of &amp;ldquo;pieces&amp;rdquo;: having to deal with cron, in addition to the rest of the stack only increases the maintainance burden: it&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget that the stack needs to have cronjobs installed, etc. One way to avoid it is to include the cron jobs in the stack, with a buildout recipe.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the wonders of WSGI and well behaved frameworks, it is now trivial to mix and match applications and have them run in the same Python process.
Normally, in a production scenario, uwsgi would be used to split and map the URL spaces to different apps, but for development it is simpler to just use good old PythonPaste. In my case, I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to have the RQ Dashboard (which is based on Flask) integrated with a Pyramid app that I&amp;rsquo;m working on.</description>

      <description>I had a curious case of missing-but-present blobs in an old Plone service, configured with a Zeo server and 2 Zope instances.
The root of the problem (I think) was that the blob folder configuration was broken: the Zope client instances were configured with shared blobs to &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo;, but they were really sharing the same caching folder.
In the end, the blobs were loaded by the Zope services and everything appeared to be working, but when I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to move the blobstorage folder to a new machine, I ended up with missing blobs.</description>

      <description>Today, new lesson learnt. I needed to test something with Internet Explorer and Edge, so I&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded the test images from the Microsoft website, then proceeded to install virtualbox, in my current KDE based ArchLinux desktop (which I love a lot). A simple pacman -S virtualbox perhaps? Yes, except&amp;hellip;
After installing virtualbox, it complained about some missing libssl2.0.0 lib&amp;hellip; so I thought maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t have that installed? I didn&amp;rsquo;t really research it, just installed openssl.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a somewhat weird experiment. My end goal is to have a user friendly (and mobile friendly) faceted search interface over the items of a collection.
Seen through the eyes of my recent experience with VueJS, the classic Plone frontend APIs, such as JQuery and Patternslib/Mockup seem outdated and hard to digest. Any dedicated frontend UI library will seem much friendlier.
My self-imposed requirements were:
 easy to work with, easily integrated.</description>

      <description>At around 450 kb of javascript code, a Quasar distribution bundle seems a bit too big. The following short recipe applies to an app generated from the Quasar Framework default template, but it probably applies to any vuejs project that uses vue-loader, and even any project using webpack.
First, we want to analyse what&amp;rsquo;s inside the bundle. A good utility is webpack-bundle-analyzer, but how to use it?
 Configure the webpack to write the stats to a json file.</description>

      <description>The new Plone 5.1 development buildout doesn&amp;rsquo;t include a zcml property in its [instance] section. It is no longer needed, with all eggs already providing a z3c.autoinclude entrypoint. This, unless you want to load an older package which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have such an entry point. That&amp;rsquo;s when the trouble starts. Adding a, for example:
[instance] ... zcml += cs.auth.facebook  doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. There is really no zcml property in any of the extended cfg file, so Zope will try to load this package first, which will result in a &amp;ldquo;permission not defined&amp;rdquo; zcml error.</description>

      <title>Using pyramid_jwt with pyramid_multiauth</title>

      <guid>/blog/2017/02/25/using-pyramid_jwt-with-pyramid_multiauth/</guid>
      <description>pyramid_jwt has its own convenience method of registering as an authentication policy, through config.set_jwt_authentication_policy. It does so because the constructor of its policy takes a lot of arguments, so it&amp;rsquo;s best to trust the package to do its own setup.
But this makes it a bit harder to use with pyramid_multiauth, as you can&amp;rsquo;t easily pass the JWTAuthenticationPolicy policy to the multiauth.policies setting. Turns out that is not hard at all.</description>

      <description>This is more of a recipe for myself, as I always have problems with npm. I&amp;rsquo;m usually stuborn and refuse to use a globally installed nodejs, and can&amp;rsquo;t be really bothered to properly install a nodejs tarball distribution, with setting up PATH and all. They&amp;rsquo;re usually throw-away and not portable between my machines.
So, a simple recipe to install nodejs on my own setup, an ArchLinux machine using fish as default shell.</description>

      <description>I always forget, and a quick search through the eggs folder didn&amp;rsquo;t yield anything easy to find: how to I assign a permission to a role, in a context?
This is a bit of code:

      <description>One common task in machine-based categorization tasks is to relabel data with a numeric value, an index, where before that data was labeled with a string.
The basic Python code would be something like this:
label_index = {} labels = [] for l in string_labels: if l not in label_index: label_index[l] = len(label_index) labels.append(label_index[l])&amp;gt;  While writing that bit of code from above, I realized that a word tokenizer can do the same thing.</description>

      <description>This is a small recipe on how to get two arrays with the same shape (same length) shuffled with the same &amp;ldquo;random seed&amp;rdquo;. This is useful when the two arrays hold related data (for example, one holds values and the other one holds labels for those values).
It takes advantage of the fact that numpy arrays can be indexed with other arrays, something that seems really magical when compared to regular python arrays.</description>

tmux In the beginning I&amp;rsquo;ve used Yakuake tabs to split servers and files in separate tabs. As the number grew, I&amp;rsquo;ve started naming the tabs (and even had a short stint extending Yakuake to fit this use case), but as the number of projects and environments that I have to juggle kept growing, I&amp;rsquo;ve resorted to splitting each separate tab into &amp;ldquo;subtabs&amp;rdquo;, using tmux.</description>

One of them combining a Ruby on Rails app with a whole suite of ElasticSearch nodes, sidekiq worker, Postgresql, nginx, the whole shebang. Another is just a plain Zope/Plone stack, but the difficulties remain the same: when I wanted to do production debugging or just plain development using that environment, I needed something that can be started manually, in the whole stack.</description>

      <description>By default, collective.cover offers one mechanism to &#34;drop&#34; objects to their tiles, by using the &#34;Add content&#34; button at the top. I&#39;ve received feedback that the button will not be very friendly to editors, so my solution, in this case, is really simple.

This allows configuring a new trigger event from the Content Rules Plone control panel configlet and to assign a new Email action, with customizable body template.

      <description>I have a Zope / Plone website with some old objects created by Products.feedfeeder and they store (for some weird reason) instances of BeautifulSoup objects. These objects were created with BeautifulSoup 3 and the installed version of BS is 4, which moved its classes in the bs4.* namespace. Now, running full-sweep searches in the site or a full catalog reindex fails because of these, now broken, objects.
My solution, because I didn&#39;t care for those stored BeautifulSoup objects, was to fake the BeautifulSoup module and patch it into sys.</description>

      <description>I needed to migrate a Kotti database, from its default sqlite file store, to Postgresql. Clued in by StackOverflow, I&#39;ve tried using pgloader, but the version coming with Ubuntu is old: 2.x instead of the brand new 3.x. But the jump to 3.x meant a switch in programming languages as well: the new one is written in Lisp. I didn&#39;t want to install and compile the whole Lisp bundle just to run pgloader and I didn&#39;t find a binary distribution either, and after a recent exposure to Docker, I thought I&#39;ll give the dockerized version of pgloader a try.</description>

      <description>This is useful for example if you have transactions that cause writes to the database and you don&#39;t know what has been written. First, identify the ID of the transaction that you&#39;re interested. In the Undo tab of Zope, inspect the checkbox for the transaction and copy the part that looks like an id from its value.
Then, in a zope debugging shell (started with bin/instance debug), I&#39;ve done:

      <description>Zope 2 (and Plone) persistent objects usually have an intricate inheritance tree. Finding what classes an object inherits can be a time consuming task, hunting through the various eggs for the relevant source code. Below is a little snippet that shows how to easily get the list of superclasses:

      <description>I had problems building PIL with jpeg support on the latest Ubuntu. There are now two libjpeg libraries: one called libjpeg62 and one libjpeg8. Every guide on the net explaining how to compile PIL with jpeg support points to installing libjpeg62-dev. Needless to say, libjpeg8-dev is actually needed to properly build PIL. My reason for initially avoiding libjpeg8 is that it causes libsdlimage-dev to be uninstalled, so it looks like I&#39;ll have to juggle packages whenever I want to compile something that requires SDL.</description>

      <description>I have a Zope product that needs to write in a centralized location, across multiple instances. The classic Python solution would be to write a variable in a config.py module and read that location from the code, but this feels unelegant in an environment that uses zc.buildout for deployment. The solution I have found is, as follows:
In buildout.cfg, in the instance part definition, add:
zope-conf-additional = &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;environment&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; mylocation ${buildout:directory}/var/mylocation &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;/environment&amp;gt;  Next, inside the product code I have:</description>

Due to that package&#39;s dependence of a sane imaplib (and the one in Python 2.4 is buggy), I had to run the script with python2.6. To make a script run on a different python, you need to do:
[myscript] recipe = zc.regipe.egg eggs = &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; myegg &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; IMAPClient python = python26 The python26 option is actually the name of a buildout part that configures the python executable path</description>

Package structure, Zope package registration, content types registration, QuickInstaller registration, GenericSetup profiles, skins registration, workflows, etc. I can go in and do changes to the code, and add to it, but generating it from scratch is a gigantic task, especially for my use case, where I need to start a new project with about 7 content types.</description>

As a side note, at first I have reviewed Satchmo, as it seemed to have more traction in the Django community (being a Zope/Plone developer, I am more aware of the previous work done by the LFS developer, the EasyShop).</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve upgraded CacheFu (Products.CacheSetup) to the latest 1.2 for some of the websites that I manage, in a Plone 2.5 cluster. One of them had a problem that I haven&#39;t been able to track previously, due to limited time: on a reinstall of CacheSetup, due to product upgrades, CacheFu couldn&#39;t be installed anymore. The traceback was something like:
this product has already been installed without Quickinstaller!failed: Traceback (most recent call last): File &#34;</description>

      <description>While testing software to play music from a computer on my network, I have discovered Elisa, which is a wonderful piece of software built in Python and zope.interface. The package manager helpfully installed a python-zopeinterface package, which turned out to break one of the apps I&#39;ve been working on (one of the packages that is used depends on a more recent version of zope.interface and breaks with a missing object import).</description>

      <description>One of my long-running projects involves a workflow where content is produced in a Plone site, with the data later extracted and processed in various ways (including scripting Scribus to layout this data in a book). Initially the site where the content was produced wasn&#39;t protected, so I could run a simple urllib script to download the content and process it using lxml. A recent change in the workflow security settings meant this script didn&#39;t work anymore and I had to remember how to login into a Plone site using urllib2.</description>

&amp;lt;div tal:content=&#34;somedict/keyname/someattr&#34; /&amp;gt; &#34;keyname&#34; is taken as a string, it&#39;s the literal name of the key for the somedict mapping. To use a variable instead of the literal value of the key name, I used to do:
&amp;lt;div tal:content=&#34;python somedict[key].someattr&#34; /&amp;gt; Browsing through the zope.app.catalog code, I saw that there&#39;s actually a way to use the TALES syntax:</description>

To solve this issue, in a pdb prompt I had to run:

      <description>Recently Martin Aspeli published a very nice buildout recipe that implements a complete setup for a production Zope/Plone server. One of the key components in that setup is the load balancer, which is implemented using the load balancer capabilities of nginx. Nginx might be a good load balancer, but it has a problem with the way Zope/Plone works: the first page loads, for a newly restarted Plone instance are very slow (especially if the site or the catalogs are big).</description>

The solution is to upgrade the installed setuptools to the latest version. For example, for a standalone Plone installed at /home/tibi/Plone, we have this structure:</description>

      <description>This is a small example app that will render a tag cloud with various font weights/height, based on their weight in the cloud. Not much to say here, hope it is useful to someone. It has actually been easier to design and create then expected, the only difficulty was in figuring out how to resize the buttons based on the size of their label. The algorithm could be improved to generate the cloud in a single pass, but I&#39;m not gonna bother, it works fast enough right now.</description>

There are times when I have an object in a template. I want to display information associated with that object. This information is already coded in a @@detail view on this object. Suppose this example (in mostly pseudocode):</description>

      <description>On a Plone 2.5 project I&#39;m working I have a content type that has 3 reference association to another content type. ArchGenXML generated the fields with the same name, which means that in the interface there will be just one field, as they overwrite each other. To have them working I need to rename them, but how to do this from the model? Agx, at first glance, doesn&#39;t have support for this.</description>

      <description>The &#34;modern&#34; (post 1.5) version of ArchGenXML is packaged as egg, available on pypi. While in theory you could run &#34;sudo easy_install archgenxml&#34; and have it running with minimal effort, because it depends on zope.component and zope.configuration, things tend to get muddy and complicated. If you&#39;ll &#34;easy_install zope.component&#34; you&#39;ll get a bunch of zope eggs installed in python&#39;s site-packages and this will probably cause problems. When I&#39;ve started developing with Zope 3 I had some hard time tracking some problems that ultimately turned out to be caused by zope packages installed in the system python &#34;</description>

      <description>When developing a Zope 2 site, the way the templates would be laid out is obvious: create a template for the site layout, use macros and slots to fill in that template and use the CMF skin overriding mechanism when you have to customize a certain template or Python script for another skin. Plone has been using this mechanism very successfully.
With Zope 3 the path is not very clear. There are several mechanisms, each with its advantages and disadvantages.</description>

      <description>Ever since I&#39;ve started working with zc.buildout I&#39;ve grown to love the whole &#34;environment as project&#34; setup that it provides: eggs and python packages are installed and contained in the buildout and they don&#39;t polute the system packages. There is another alternative: workingenv, which, while simpler in scope, it is easier to setup and use. For example, recently I&#39;ve wanted to see if lxml 2.0 can be installed in my system.</description>

      <description>Lately it has been possible to develop and simply deploy a Zope 3 based application by organizing code in a single Python package that uses zope3 packages as dependency, plus a buildout recipe that creates a running zope 3 instance based on these eggs. For anyone using Eclipse + PyDev, this approach has the following inconvenience: the `eggs` folder can&#39;t be properly imported as external source folder for the project. Eclipse knows about eggs, but only when they&#39;re in marked in a .</description>

Recently I needed to integrate it with some of my content types (but not exactly as a tagging widget, but as a global registry for a global vocabulary), so I&#39;ve created a couple of new widgets (an AJAX based multi-autocomplete one, based on z3c.widget.autocomplete and an add/remove widget, based on Plone&#39;s 3rd party AddRemoveWidget).</description>

How lame is that Windows doesn&#39;t automount USB sticks when they&#39;re present at boot time? Why would I have to remove+reinsert the stick just so Windows will see the bloody thing? My Kubuntu, of course, handles perfectly everything in this department (at least in my case).</description>

      <description>To insert a rendered viewlet manager into a page, one uses something like &#34;tal:replace=&#34;structure provider: ILeftSide&#34;. Of course, viewlet managers are providers, they implement the IContentProvider interface and are looked up with this interface in the &#39;provider&#39; TALES handler. One particular trick that content providers do is that they allow insertion of TAL data from the template, to make it accessible inside the content provider class. A sort of &#34;parameters&#34;, as it is detailed in the README.</description>

      <description>Getting the traverse subpath in Zope 2 is relatively easy and involves almost no tricks. Doing the same thing in Zope3 is a bit more involved, but nevertheless still relatively easy. What might not be obvious at first is how to traverse to the page from Python code. Call me slow, but it took me about 2 minutes to think of the solution.
The idea is: I have a page along these lines: http://localhost/site/tips/page_context/next.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve found a weird issue while trying to debug why on of my Ajax loaded forms wasn&#39;t, apparently, properly validated. Even though that the schema specified that the fields are required, the form action would get executed as if the validation wouldn&#39;t have been done or the request was properly validated. I thought at first that there&#39;s an issue with the form class/handling itself, but after some testing I came to the conclusion that it has to be the way I&#39;m doing the AJAX request.</description>

      <description>Problem: I need to get the skin name for a Zope 3 interface registered as skin.
Solution
Starting with Zope 3.3, the skinning mechanism has been simplified and skins are now just interfaces. This means that a skin interface is now a named utility for the IBrowserSkinType. To get the name with which this class has been registered as an utility, something along these lines is needed:

This application uses HTML and CSS as its presentation layer (right, it&#39;s a web page), with a bit of Ajax thrown in. Due do time constraints, I&#39;m not even trying to get it to work properly on Internet Explorer (although it looks about 90% right, but I have some problems with Javascript), so I won&#39;t be embeding the Internet Explorer this time engine in my Python application, I&#39;ll just try to get the Gecko rendering engine, the one used in Firefox.</description>

Plus, when I&#39;ve started writing this application, I&#39;ve started doing the layout with viewlets and managers, and it seems that for each viewlet that I&#39;m creating I have to have a way to get its content through AJAX, which means having a page available for it, and this is very odd, as it almost defeats the point of having viewlets.</description>

Trying to get the macros with something like context/@@page_with_macros/macros/the_macro doesn&#39;t work, as BrowserView (and BrowserPage) doesn&#39;t know anything about Zope Page Templates. Of course, that&#39;s also because Zope 3 doesn&#39;t directly publishes templates, only pages.</description>

      <description>I recently encountered a problem that I presume would be pretty common when creating a site based on the z3c.layer.minimal browser layer: the resources, although accessible as ++resource++resource_name, are not accessible at the default location used by packages as zc.resourcelibrary: http://localhost/site/@@/resource_name
The reason, as I have guessed, was that a certain page or view was missing, not being registered for the IMinimalLayer, which doesn&#39;t inherit from the IBrowserDefaultLayer. Grepping for &#34;</description>

      <description>You probably know by now that Plone sites are better suited at content creation that content delivery. Still, the Plone solution is too good to pass even when creating simpler sites, where +99% of the trafic will be anonymous one. And when you have a good hammer, everything looks like a nail.
One of the various problems that Plone has when delivering this brochure type of websites is that the page weight is pretty high.</description>

      <description>Today I had to setup the hosting of a Zope 3 application on a FreeBSD server. I don&#39;t have much love for FreeBSD as I&#39;m used to the Debian way of doing things, but after a couple of hours of tweaking the apache configuration files and the application I managed to get it properly running on that server.
Some pointers to quickly getting things done:
default apache on FreeBSD doesn&#39;t have mod_proxy installed.</description>

      <description>Recently I encountered a permission problem that I guess can be tipical when working with adapters based on marker interfaces (such as implementing IRatableItem with a class and adapting it to IRating).
The code is classic simplistic example of adaptation, using the IAnnotation to store a rating, with the adapter being something along these lines:
from interfaces import IRating
from zope.annotation.interfaces import IAnnotations
from zope.interface import implements
class RatingAdapter(object):
implements(IRating)</description>

      <description>I&#39;m working on a project that mostly extends an older, legacy based Plone 2.0 project. This project has a CMFFormController form with about 20 fields and based on that input needs to create new AT content items, which is done in the action script of the controller chain. To achieve this, I have the following code:
First, I have a field_mapping that maps the fields from the form to the AT field names.</description>

      <title>Custom traversing with Five and ITraversable</title>

      <guid>/blog/2006/10/21/custom-traversing-with-five-and-itraversable/</guid>
      <description>This blog already contains a technique on how to customize the traversal to return any object, using __bobo_traverse__
A more simple, modern and elegant way of doing achieving this is detailed in the newly released ImageRepository. Basically, it uses an adapter to change the implementation for ITraversable when the traversal is done on an object implementing a marker interface. I&#39;ve lifted the relevant code and pasted it below, but the original sources should be consulted for reference.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I just want to test a package under the zope namespace (installed usually in /opt/Zope2.9/lib/python or /usr/local/Zope3.2/lib/python), like for example the zope.testbrowser the other day. The easiest way to achieve this, without messing around with PYTHONHOME environment variables, or appending paths to sys.path is to change directory to the lib/python folder and start the python interpretor there. Because python will look in the current folder for modules and packages, they will be available in the interpretor.</description>

      <description>For some reason, the set_file method is not available for ListControls file upload objects inside the Browser object. To be able to fill in the file field, one needs to do
myfilecontrol.mech_control.set_file(filestream, mimetype, filename). The problem gets weirder as set_file() is the method indicated by the README.txt doctest of zope.testbrowser package as the way to upload a file stream in a file upload widget, and I presume the README.txt test doesn&#39;t fail.</description>

      <description>The normal ZCatalog queries and indexes are extremely limited. For example, I had a need to check for a &#34;Value not in KeywordIndex&#34; expression, which is impossible to do with the normal catalog. AdvancedQuery comes to the rescue, but things aren&#39;t too obvious there either. AQ has a In() expression that can be used in building queries, but it does the reverse thing: check something like &#34;IndexedValue not in ListOfValues&#34;.</description>

      <description>One thing the documentation doesn&#39;t clearly state: you can set the status to a value and have that value defined as an action in the metadata file, basically redirecting the flow of the controller sequence to that action. To make things clear, I&#39;ll paste some code. In the login_initial.cpy.metadata file from CMFPlone we have this bit of code:
[actions]
action.success=traverse_to:string:login_next
action.login_change_password=traverse_to:string:login_passwordSo basically we have two actions defined, depending on the type of status returned.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m using this technique for a site created with Plone 2.1, but it I think it can work on Plone 2.5 as well. Basically, I need a site with different membership types, and each membership type has a &#34;personal area&#34; (different member folder) where the user can add different object types and generally have a completely different browsing experience. I haven&#39;t implemented anything exotic such as CMFMember (not future proof) or membrane (not compatible, don&#39;t want to mess around yet) so I&#39;m sticking with plain Plone users.</description>

      <description>I had a need to create new external methods on install of a product. So, even if technique is old and well know to any Zope 2 old-timer, I&#39;m placing this here for my own reference.
def install(portal):
portal.manage_addProduct[&#39;ExternalMethod&#39;].manage_addExternalMethod(
id = &#39;emailMe&#39;,
title=&#39;emailMe&#39;,
module=&#39;MyProduct.emailMe&#39;,
function=&#39;emailMe&#39;)The code needs to interact with a legacy module (renamed here emailMe). The idea is that manage_addProduct returns a dictionary of factories and manage_addExternalMethod is the factory method defined in the ExternalMethod module.</description>

      <description>Sometimes there is a need to get a translated piece of content in a particular language. Some examples include messing around with ATVM or stitching together a front page for a multilanguage website from editable content (site editors love pretty interfaces where they can tweak and edit every piece of a website). This piece of code is a bit older, but still does the job well. The boundLanguages/getLanguageBindings thing could be replaced with getPreferredLanguage() and I&#39;m pretty sure LinguaPlone got a prettier API than this, but it&#39;s a starting point in the right direction.</description>

sudo easy_install i18ndudeSince I&#39;m using ArchGenXML, I already have a generated.pot file created. I&#39;ve renamed this file to old.pot and ran this (in the i18n folder):
i18ndude rebuild-pot --pot ./generated.pot --merge old.pot --create MyProduct ./../skins/MyProduct/

The code below will make the explanation easier to understand:

      <description>Due to hardware corruption I have a broken Data.fs that won&#39;t pack. To fix it the fsrecover.py script from the ZODB module can be used. For example, this is how to run the script to repair the broken database (I have zope installed in /opt/Zope2.8):
cd /opt/Zope2.8/lib/python/
python ZODB/fsrecover.py -v 1 /mnt/raid/Data.fs /mnt/raid/Data.fs.fixed
The reason to run the fsrecover script with ZODB in front is that it imports from the ZODB module.</description>

      <description>To display properly, an RSS 2 feed needs to have the date entered in something resembling this format:
&amp;lt;pubDate&amp;gt;Thu, 21 Sep 2006 15:15:26 GMT&amp;lt;/pubDate&amp;gt;This is needed to get a date to display in this format:
&amp;lt;pubDate tal:content=&#34;python: DateTime(res.Date).rfc822()&#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/pubDate&amp;gt; </description>

Simply put, Five views are just like TTW python scripts, except without the limited forced security, and with the possibility to integrate them in unit testing and adapt them to other protocols then just http.

      <description>As hard as I have tried to find, there&#39;s no good printing framework for wxPython. wxEasyPrinting sucks so much for anything more then simple text (for example, the table cells don&#39;t support specifying a height). Generating PDF files with a toolkit such as ReportLab (even with Platypus) is harder then it should be, especially when there&#39;s no ready made higher level framework. This page explores some of the common printing solutions on Windows.</description>

      <description>To specify the default view for an AT archetype the &#34;view&#34; action needs to be overriden. Adding a default_actions=True tagged value in the model will generate a view action that will use the base_view template. To be able to change the view action, default_actions should be deleted from the model and replaced with a base_actions=my_actions.
The my_actions statement could look like this:
my_actions = (
{&#39;action&#39;: &#39;string:${object_url}/base_edit&#39;,
&#39;category&#39;: &#39;object&#39;,
&#39;id&#39;: &#39;edit&#39;,</description>

      <description>I recently had a need for an &#34;administration screen&#34; for an AT-based content that would give the administrators just one field to edit and following that edit, change the workflow state of that piece of content.
Usually, to limit the fields visible in the edit form, I would give those fields different write permissions. Obviously, in this case this was not possible, so I had to take another path. Easiest way to achieve my goal was something like this:</description>

How to configure Office applications to run under the interactive user accountConsiderations for server-side Automation of OfficeI ran through the steps in the first article and I can attest that it&#39;s possible to use Microsoft Word to generate, for example, PDF files by printing them from a service. I have the feeling that most of those steps are not needed if Word is not accessed as a COM service, and all is needed is to create a new user, start and configure Word to have a running instance and then configure the service to run as that user.</description>

First, the validator has to be registered with Archetypes, or zope will complain at startup and ignore the validator. So add something like this in the __init__.py of the product:
from Products.validation import validation
from validators import SamePasswordValidator
validation.register(SamePasswordValidator(&#39;isSamePassword&#39;))Next, the source code for the validator (validators.</description>

      <description>An observation: when you want to specify the roles that are required for a user to have in order to create a piece of content, you&#39;ll have to also specify a creation permission.
This means that the following tagged values are required, to something like:
creation_permission = Create MyContent
creation_roles = python: (&#39;Anonymous&#39;, &#39;Member&#39;)This generates the following code in config.py:
DEFAULT_ADD_CONTENT_PERMISSION = &#34;Add portal content&#34;

First, our tools: py2exe has, among its deployment targets, a &#34;windows service&#34; option, so we&#39;ll need that. To manage the service and interact with the Windows event log, the Python win32 extension is needed. Py2exe has a sample service in the samples/advanced folder, on which I&#39;ve based my code.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you have code that has a lot of print statements, which are helping you with debugging. But what happens if you try to port that code to an environment without a console? In the best case, you won&#39;t see the prints anymore, in the worse case, the code will fail because there&#39;s no &#34;valid file descriptor&#34; to which to write.
The solution to this problem is to replace python&#39;s stdout file, which will enable the code output to be recorded and maybe logged for debugging purposes.</description>

Anyway, here&#39;s his recipe to running ZEO
&amp;lt;joelburton&amp;gt; having your site running under zeo also allows you to &#34;zopectl debug&#34; it while it&#39;s still running, which is insanely useful. i _always_ run zope under zeo, even during development, even on my laptop, etc., and i recommend that to others.
&amp;lt;joelburton&amp;gt; thegoldenaura: zeo just splits zope-the-app-server and zope-the-database into two

The reason is that the panel component will enable tab traversal. Also, the panel can so be used to group the widgets into logical groups, to facilitate traversing them with the tab key. Oh, did I mention wxGlade (from cvs) rules? </description>

      <description>LDAP is a lot easier then one might think at first sight. First, reading this short introduction to LDAP will tell us that LDAP is just an object database, that holds trees of objects and schemas of those objects. This is nice and easy for anyone acustomed to ZODB and Archetypes.
Next, installing. The OpenLDAP server on Debian is called slapd, so apt-get install slapd. After that, run dpkg-reconfigure -plow slapd which will allow reconfiguring the domains.</description>

      <description>Just like the edit form or the view page can be overriden for an AT type, so can the form controler script that would be called by the form. This recipe is lifted from SignupSheet (which I think got an inspiration from POI):
The form controler script (mytype_post.cpy):
##bind container=container
##bind context=context
##bind namespace=
##bind script=script
##bind state=state
##bind subpath=traverse_subpath
##parameters=
##title=Do something
##
#do something here, like for example, changing the workflow status of the object</description>

      <description>To get an object completely stripped of its acquisition layers, the following snippet can be employed
import Acquisition
obj_no_aq = Acquisition.aq_base(obj)
No acquisition means no methods or properties inherited from the container or the container chain.
Although a bit old, the Zope Developer Guide, with its chapter on Acquisition do a fine job at explaining the intricacies of acquisition in Zope 2.</description>

      <description>I recently had a need to get a list of the indexes from the portal_catalog.
While the metadata has an API method to get it, using something along:
pc = getToolByName(self, &#39;portal_catalog&#39;)
metadatas = pc.enumerateColumns()I couldn&#39;t find the equivalent API method to get the Indexes. After digging through the DTML files used by ZCatalog, I came up with the following method:
pc = getToolByName(self, &#39;portal_catalog&#39;)
indexes = pc.Indexes.objectIds() </description>

      <description>It happened to me several times, and I always forget what the problem is. Sometimes a product reinstall (from QuickInstaller) fails with an odd error: AttributeError: manage_addTool. This only means that the product is broken. Make a visit to the Zope Control Panel \ Products and look in the refresh page for the product on the real reason why it fails.</description>

      <description>While this method is superceeded by GenericSetup, it&#39;s usefull enough that I place it here.
ptypes = portal.portal_types
psite = getattr(ptypes, &#39;Plone Site&#39;)

vm = list(view_methods) + [&#39;main_frontpage&#39;]

      <title>Using z3 style events</title>

      <description>Based on my previous entry on at_post_create_script, I was curios on how to achieve something like that using z3 style events. Now, I know that it&#39;s not the same and the following events are meant only to replace manage_afterAdd and so on, but I&#39;m pretty sure that there are (or will be) events fired that would replace the at_post_* scripts.
So, easy as it gets:
Create a new python package inside the zope Products folder, add the following method inside __init__.</description>

      <title>How to access directly fields and widgets from an Archetypes content</title>

      <guid>/blog/2006/07/21/how-to-access-directly-fields-and-widgets-from-an-archetypes-content/</guid>
      <description>There are two ways to access the field values and widgets from inside an AT content item. First, a more complex example on getting fields and widgets properties using self.schema:
for fname in self.schema.keys():
field = self.schema.get(fname)
widget = field.widget
widgetLabel = widget.Label(self)
fieldValue = field.get(self))
To get a field value, one could use  self.schema[&#39;customer_copy_to&#39;].get(self)The second way uses self.Schema() and shows the equivalent of the above example
self.Schema().getField(&#39;customer_copy_to&#39;).get(self)
Of course, there&#39;s always the default generated AT getters, but sometimes it&#39;s not possible to use those (for example, when you want to get the raw value of a field.</description>

      <description>When using at_post_create_script to hook up in the &#34;post creation&#34; events of AT, if the content type has multiple schematas, the script will be called each time the &#34;next&#34; button is pushed.
To properly use the script, a check can be added to see if the &#34;save&#34; button was pressed:
security.declarePrivate(&#39;at_post_create_script&#39;)
def at_post_create_script(self, **kwargs):
if self.REQUEST.get(&#39;form_submit&#39;, None) == &#39;Save&#39;:
pass #do something here </description>
