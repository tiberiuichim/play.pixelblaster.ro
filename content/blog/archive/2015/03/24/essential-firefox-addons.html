<p>Without these addons, Firefox may not be my favourite browser. With them, it's a beast that has no match among all other browsers. So, a top 10 of my favourite extensions:</p>
<ul><li>Vimperator: the essential plugin, makes Firefox behave in a modal manner similar to VIM. Includes many shortcuts similar to vim. Integrates an external editor (like GVim) with any textarea. My favourite things with it: really fast opening/closing of tabs, URL address copying and pasting, follow links, etc. Just awsome. The external editor thingy has no easy answer in Chrome, where you'd have to be running an http proxy, because addons are sandboxed and can't access the disk.<br /></li><li>TreeStyleTabs: another awesome plugin, with no match in the Chrome world, where sidebars are an external window.</li><li>SessionManager: Firefox has a built-in, but SM is better</li><li>LastPass: while I have Firefox sync enabled, it is better to be able to access those login information from my mobile devices.</li><li>Auto Unload Tab: when you have 100+ tabs loaded, it's a requirement. Firefox has an automatic unload tab feature, but it can't be controlled and in my experience, it didn't work well.</li><li>Ghostery + uBlock: get rid of annoying stuff</li><li>Flashgot: I use it sometimes to make backups of video streams. For youtube I use youtube-dl.</li><li>Clearly: easy saving content to Evernote<br /></li></ul>
<p>In the past, Firebug would have been at the front of this list, but right now it's buggy, slows down the browser (switching tabs), so it gets ignored in favour of Chromium.</p>
